          <InfoH3>External Sorting</InfoH3>
          <p>
            External sorting is used when buffer size is insufficient to store
            and sort all pages in-memory. With N data pages and B buffer frames,
            Pass 0 creates ⌈N/B⌉ runs, each needing 2 I/O operations. Subsequent
            passes merge and sort pages until completion. Total passes needed: 1
            + ⌈log(B-1)⌈N/B⌉⌉, with a cost estimate of 2 × N × #passes.
            Optimization can be achieved by applying relational operators in the
            right order, reducing I/O operations.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Pipelining sends output directly between operators, reducing I/O
              operations and allowing parallel execution.

          <InfoH3>Projection</InfoH3>
          Projection is usually done on-the-fly with other operations i.e.,
          pipelining. In case the query requires `DISTINCT` results, it requires
          a sort to eliminate duplicates. This is usually done at the very end
          (when there may be fewer tuples due to other operations), or when the
          relation is sorted for some other reason.

              <code>INTERSECTION</code> and cross-product are special cases of

            <li>
              <code>UNION</code> (distinct) can be achieved by sorting both
              relations on the combination of all attributes and then merging
              both the relations (keeping only one of the duplicate records).
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>EXCEPT</code> can be implemented in a similar way by sorting
              both relations followed by merging and keeping out the records
              that match with those in the <em>except</em> table.

              with any join method.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the <code>EXISTS</code> operator, we have to execute the inner

              <h4>Algebraic</h4>
              Algebraic optimization focuses on reducing data flow between
              operators by pushing down selections and projections in the query
              evaluation path. It requires statistical information about the
              data.

              and comparing the costs of using different algorithms to perform
              operations such as joins. It considers available indexes and
              operator implementation algorithms.

              <i>Given the query, find the best execution plan.</i>
              <p> Steps:
                  <ol>
                      <li> First read the 20,000 pages of babySitting, use the selection on availdate and pipeline it to projection and store only the required fields (ssid, totalhrs, addnlChildren) of the selected records in the memory buffers. The width of the output tuple is 4+4+4 = 12, and can be done into 2 frames ⇒ temp1. The number of records in temp1 will be 1,000,000 x 5/10,000 = 500 . Total IO is 20,000 reads.</li>
                      <li> Block Nested with temp1 as outer and sitter as the inner relation. Temp1 is in memory so join read cost = 20 (for sitter). Compute the amount earned for this babysitting reservation save only required fields (ssid, sname, amt), width = 4+20+8 = 32 ... takes about 4 frames (no need to write can be held in memory). Total IO = 20 reads</li>
                      <li> Do an in memory sorting based on ssid, sname. This is then grouped (in memory) - pipelined to sum - and pipeline to project - and send to client directly.</li>
                  </ol>
                  Total IO is therefore only 20,000 + 20 = 20,020
              </p>
              <hr/>
              <i>Suggest any indexes that you can add/modify in the tables to decrease the I/O cost of the
                  above query. Describe the new execution plan and compute the costs.</i>
              <p> Steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a clustered index on availDate of babySitting</li>
                        <li>For selection operator on availDate use this index and , read 1 leaf page + 10 data pages , project and store only required fields in memory (ssid, totalhrs, addnlChildren) (2 frames) {"->"} temp1 = 11 reads</li>
                    </ol>
                  Rest of the steps same as before - results in 11 + 20 = 31 I/O
