              The advantage of having a clustered index is that the intermediate
              and leaf nodes, as well as the actual data, are sorted on the same
              attribute, making it easier to access successive data. Since the
              actual data is also sorted, we can quickly access the next N
              records without looking back at the index, for example.

              However, if the actual data were not sorted in the same way as the

            It is possible to create an index with more than one attribute.
            However, the order of indexing matters. The data is first ordered by
            attribute 1, followed by attribute 2, which is used in cases of ties
            when comparing by attribute 1, and so on.

            are 3 entries per leaf page, and thus 500/3 = 167 leaf pages.
            Calculating 500*1003/3000=167 or 168 also ok. Also ok to say 2 fit
            on each leaf page (although that’s stretching it because there was a
            lot of discussion on Ed, but then it would be 500/2=250 leaf pages.

          <KeyValue value={"Access Path"}>
            The method used to retrieve tuples from a relation.
          </KeyValue>
          <KeyValue value={"Cost model"}>
            It's how we compare different access paths. Considers: the query,
            database statistics (distribution of values, etc), and resource
            availability (CPU, I/O, memory...)
          </KeyValue>
          <KeyValue value={"Execution tree"}>
            depicts the execution flow of a query. The execution flow starts at
            the leaves of the tree and moves upward toward the root.{" "}
            <ul>
              <li>Leaf nodes are base relations.</li>
              <li>Inner nodes are operators.</li>
              <li>
                Tuples from base relations (leaves) flow into the parent
                operator node(s).
              </li>
              <li>
                The output of an operator node flows into the parent node.
              </li>
              <li>
                The output of the root node flows as a result to the client.
              </li>
            </ul>
